# Contributing to SuperSimpleSystem RPG
We believe that contributing to the SuperSimpleSystem Role Play Game should be as easy as to actually play a game within that system. Therefore we do our best to keep the whole process as simple as possible.  

## principles
Having said that, let's take a look at the principles:
1. read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/TheBlackWolfPack/SuperSimpleSystem-RPG/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) - simple version: be nice and respect others
2. crate a new fork of our [main repository](https://github.com/TheBlackWolfPack/SuperSimpleSystem-RPG.git)
3. create a new branch based on the main branch in your fork for each contribution you would like to do
4. create / modify the files for your contribution; this can range from improvements on details of existing documents up to contributing a totally new rule set or character sheet sets
5. commit your changes to the branch in your fork on github.com
6. create a pull request to our main branch once you have everything set up by filing the template with a maningful description and the needed information
7. wait for your pull request to be reviewed; we will contact you in case of any question or doubt and probably ask for some changes; if everything was fine your pull request will be merged to our main branch and you will be added to the list of contributors on our website if you opted in for it.

## special cases
There are some special cases when contributing to SSS RPG, of course.
### adventures
As each and every adventure will consist a ton of files, they are living in a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/TheBlackWolfPack/SSS-RPG-adventures). Each and every adventure is using a dedicated branch on that repository. The main branch on that repository is considered a kind of template to be used to start your own new adventure.

### website
Our website is livining in a dedicated repository on github: [gh_pages](https://github.com/TheBlackWolfPack/SuperSimpleSystem-RPG.git)  
You can contribute to our website the same way following the principles. The only difference is to create your branch based on the branch "gh_pages".  
Most of our webite is created by using markdown files and an automated github action to translate them to HTML and show them on the internet.

### wiki
You can contribute to our wiki by writing new articles or improving existing ones. To do so [contact us](mailto:SuperSimpleSystemRPG@gmail.com) so that we can add you to our editors team.
